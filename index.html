            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My name is Sebastian.I am 18 years old, I am orginially from Poland and moved to <em>Ireland</em> at the age of 3. I have grown to love the country for its culture but also the people (sometimes even "The Sesh") Here is a pic of me (rarely ever see me in labs). I study computer science and attended Carrigaline Community School before that. </p>
